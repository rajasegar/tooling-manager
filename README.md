Compare your JavaScript Tech Stack against industry standard boilerplates.

## Find out the missing tools in your projects

By scanning your package.json or github repo and comparing with our database of tools categorized by their functions, we let you know what are the important tooling you are missing in your projects.

## Compare your project stack against the famous boilerplates

You can compare your projects with other projects and boilerplates in Github to see what the tooling are used in theirs versus yours, which will help you to make better decisions about what you need in your projects and what not.

## Generate beautiful timelines about your project dependencies

Find your oldest and latest packages installed in your projects from this generated timeline. You can also have information about what is the latest version available for your dependencies and the date they were published.

Built with SvelteKit, everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
